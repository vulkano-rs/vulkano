# Examples

These examples use unreleased functionality of vulkano.
For a snapshot of the examples at the latest vulkano release take a look at the [examples repository](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano-examples)

## Running the examples:

```sh
cargo run --bin <example>
```

## Example:

```sh
cargo run --bin triangle
```

If you want to compare performances with other libraries, you should pass the `--release` flag as
well. Rust is pretty slow in debug mode.
