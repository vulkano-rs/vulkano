    // Now let's get to the actual example.

    // What we are going to do is very basic: we are going to fill a buffer with 64k integers
    // and ask the GPU to multiply each of them by 12.
    //
    // GPUs are very good at parallel computations (SIMD-like operations), and thus will do this
    // much more quickly than a CPU would do. While a CPU would typically multiply them one by one
    // or four by four, a GPU will do it by groups of 32 or 64.
    //
    // Note however that in a real-life situation for such a simple operation the cost of
    // accessing memory usually outweighs the benefits of a faster calculation. Since both the CPU
    // and the GPU will need to access data, there is no other choice but to transfer the data
    // through the slow PCI express bus.

    // We need to create the compute pipeline that describes our operation.

    // pipelines are much simpler to create.
