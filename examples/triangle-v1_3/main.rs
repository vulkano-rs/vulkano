// Welcome to the triangle example!
//
// This is the only example that is entirely detailed. All the other examples avoid code
// duplication by using helper functions.
//
// This example assumes that you are already more or less familiar with graphics programming and
// that you want to learn Vulkan. This means that for example it won't go into details about what a
// vertex or a shader is.
//
// This version of the triangle example is written using dynamic rendering instead of render pass
// and framebuffer objects. If your device does not support Vulkan 1.3 or the
// `khr_dynamic_rendering` extension, or if you want to see how to support older versions, see the
// original triangle example.
