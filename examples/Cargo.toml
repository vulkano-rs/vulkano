# The `vulkano` crate is the main crate that you must use to use Vulkan.

# The Vulkan library doesn't provide any functionality to create and handle windows, as
# this would be out of scope. In order to open a window, we are going to use the `winit` crate.

# The `vulkano_win` crate is the link between `vulkano` and `winit`. Vulkano doesn't know about winit,
# and winit doesn't know about vulkano, so import a crate that will provide a link between the two.
