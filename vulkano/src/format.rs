//! All the formats supported by Vulkan.
//!
//! A format is mostly used to describe the texel data of an image. However, formats also show up in
//! a few other places, most notably to describe the format of vertex buffers.
//!
//! # Format support
//!
//! Not all formats are supported by every device. Those that devices do support may only be
//! supported for certain use cases. It is an error to use a format where it is not supported, but
//! you can query a device beforehand for its support by calling the `properties` method on a format
//! value. You can use this to select a usable format from one or more suitable alternatives.
//! Some formats are required to be always supported for a particular usage. These are listed in the
//! [tables in the Vulkan specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap43.html#features-required-format-support).
//!
//! # Special format types
//!
//! ## Depth/stencil formats
//!
//! Depth/stencil formats can be identified by the `D` and `S` components in their names. They are
//! used primarily as the format for framebuffer attachments, for the purposes of depth and stencil
//! testing.
//!
//! Some formats have only a depth or stencil component, while others combine both. The two
//! components are represented as separate *aspects*, which means that they can be accessed
//! individually as separate images. These pseudo-images have the same resolution, but different
//! bit depth and numeric representation.
//!
//! Depth/stencil formats deviate from the others in a few more ways. Their data representation is
//! considered opaque, meaning that they do not have a fixed layout in memory nor a fixed size per
//! texel. They also have special limitations in several operations such as copying; a depth/stencil
//! format is not compatible with any other format, only with itself.
//!
//! ## Block-compressed formats
//!
//! A block-compressed format uses compression to encode a larger block of texels into a smaller
//! number of bytes. Individual texels are no longer represented in memory, only the block as a
//! whole. An image must consist of a whole number of blocks, so the dimensions of an image must be
//! a whole multiple of the block dimensions. Vulkan supports several different compression schemes,
//! represented in Vulkano by the `CompressionType` enum.
//!
//! Overall, block-compressed formats do not behave significantly differently from regular formats.
//! They are mostly restricted in terms of compatibility. Because of the compression, the notion of
//! bits per component does not apply, so the `components` method will only return whether a
//! component is present or not.
//!
//! ## YCbCr formats
//!
//! YCbCr, also known as YUV, is an alternative image representation with three components:
//! Y for luminance or *luma* (overall brightness) and two color or *chroma* components Cb and Cr
//! encoding the blueness and redness respectively. YCbCr formats are primarily used in video
//! applications. In Vulkan, the formats used to encode YCbCr data use the green channel to
//! represent the luma component, while the blue and red components hold the chroma.
//!
//! To use most YCbCr formats in an [image view](crate::image::view), a feature known as
//! *sampler YCbCr conversion* is needed. It must be enabled on both the image view and any
//! combined image samplers in shaders that the image view is attached to. This feature handles
//! the correct conversion between YCbCr input data and RGB data inside the shader. To query whether
//! a format requires the conversion, you can call `requires_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` on a format.
//! As a rule, any format with `444`, `422`, `420`, `3PACK` or `4PACK` in the name requires it.
//!
//! Almost all YCbCr formats make use of **chroma subsampling**. This is a technique whereby the two
//! chroma components are encoded using a lower resolution than the luma component. The human eye is
//! less sensitive to color detail than to detail in brightness, so this allows more detail to be
//! encoded in less data. Chroma subsampling is indicated with one of three numbered suffixes in a
//! format name:
//! - `444` indicates a YCbCr format without chroma subsampling. All components have the same
//!   resolution.
//! - `422` indicates horizontal chroma subsampling. The horizontal resolution of the chroma
//!   components is halved, so a single value is shared within a 2x1 block of texels.
//! - `420` indicates horizontal and vertical chroma subsampling. Both dimensions of the chroma
//!   components are halved, so a single value is shared within a 2x2 block of texels.
//!
//! Most YCbCr formats, including all of the `444` and `420` formats, are **multi-planar**. Instead
//! of storing the components of a single texel together in memory, the components are separated
//! into *planes*, which act like independent images. In 3-plane formats, the planes hold the Y,
//! Cb and Cr components respectively, while in 2-plane formats, Cb and Cr are combined into a
//! two-component plane. Where chroma subsampling is applied, plane 0 has the full resolution, while
//! planes 1 and 2 have reduced resolution. Effectively, they are standalone images with half the
//! resolution of the original.
//!
//! The texels of multi-planar images cannot be accessed individually, for example to copy or blit,
//! since the components of each texel are split across the planes. Instead, you must access each
//! plane as an individual *aspect* of the image. A single-plane aspect of a multi-planar image
//! behaves as a regular image, and even has its own format, which can be queried with the `plane`
//! method on a format.
