///
/// TODO: finish this section
/// - All color and depth/stencil attachments used by any given subpass must have the same number
///   of samples.
/// - The trait methods should always return the same values, unless you modify the description
///   through a mutable borrow. Once you pass the `RenderPassDesc` object to vulkano, you can still
///   access it through the `RenderPass::desc()` method that returns a shared borrow to the
///   description. It must not be possible for a shared borrow to modify the description in such a
///   way that the description changes.
/// - The provided methods shouldn't be overriden with fancy implementations. For example
///   `build_render_pass` must build a render pass from the description and not a different one.
