///
/// - The number of color attachments must be less than the limit of the physical device.
/// - All the attachments in `color_attachments` and `depth_stencil` must have the same
///   samples count.
/// - If any attachment is used as both an input attachment and a color or
///   depth/stencil attachment, then each use must use the same layout.
/// - Elements of `preserve_attachments` must not be used in any of the other members.
/// - If `resolve_attachments` is not empty, then all the resolve attachments must be attachments
///   with 1 sample and all the color attachments must have more than 1 sample.
/// - If `resolve_attachments` is not empty, all the resolve attachments must have the same format
///   as the color attachments.
/// - If the first use of an attachment in this renderpass is as an input attachment and the
///   attachment is not also used as a color or depth/stencil attachment in the same subpass,
///   then the loading operation must not be `Clear`.
