//! Targets on which your draw commands are executed.
//! 
//! # Render passes and framebuffers
//!
//! There are two concepts in Vulkan:
//! 
//! - A `RenderPass` is a collection of one or multiples passes called subpasses. Each subpass
//!   contains the format and dimensions of the attachments that are part of the subpass. The
//!   render pass only defines the layout of the rendering process.
//! - A `Framebuffer` contains the list of actual images that are attached. It is created from a
//!   render pass and has to match its characteristics.
//!
//! You can create graphics pipelines from a render pass object alone.
//! A `Framebuffer` is only needed when you add draw commands to a command buffer.
//!
//! # Render passes
//!
//! In vulkano, a render pass is any object that implements the `RenderPass` trait.
//!
//! You can create a render pass by creating a `UnsafeRenderPass` object. But as its name tells,
//! it is unsafe because a lot of safety checks aren't performed.
//!
//! Instead you are encouraged to use a safe wrapper around an `UnsafeRenderPass`.
//! There are two ways to do this:   TODO add more ways
//!
//! - Creating an instance of an `EmptySinglePassRenderPass`, which describes a render pass with no
//!   attachment and with one subpass.
//! - Using the `single_pass_renderpass!` macro. See the documentation of this macro.
//!
//! Render passes have three characteristics:
//!
//! - A list of attachments with their format.
//! - A list of subpasses, that defines for each subpass which attachment is used for which
//!   purpose.
//! - A list of dependencies between subpasses. Vulkan implementations are free to reorder the
//!   subpasses, which means that you need to declare dependencies if the output of a subpass
//!   needs to be read in a following subpass.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! With `EmptySinglePassRenderPass`:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use vulkano::framebuffer::EmptySinglePassRenderPass;
//!
//! # let device: std::sync::Arc<vulkano::device::Device> = unsafe { ::std::mem::uninitialized() };
//! let renderpass = EmptySinglePassRenderPass::new(&device);
//! ```
//!
//! # Framebuffers
//!
//! Creating a framebuffer is done by passing the render pass object, the dimensions of the
//! framebuffer, and the list of attachments to `Framebuffer::new()`.
//!
//! The slightly tricky part is that the type that contains the list of attachments depends on
//! the trait implementation of `RenderPass`. For example if you use an
//! `EmptySinglePassRenderPass`, you have to pass `()` for the list of attachments.
//!
