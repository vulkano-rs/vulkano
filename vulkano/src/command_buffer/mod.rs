//! Commands that the GPU will execute (includes draw commands).
//!
//! With Vulkan, before the GPU can do anything you must create a `CommandBuffer`. A command buffer
//! is a list of commands that will executed by the GPU. Once a command buffer is created, you can
//! execute it. A command buffer must always be created even for the most simple tasks.
//!
//! # Primary and secondary command buffers.
//!
//! There are three types of command buffers:
//!
//! - **Primary command buffers**. They can contain any command. They are the only type of command
//!   buffer that can be submitted to a queue.
//! - **Secondary "graphics" command buffers**. They can only contain draw and clear commands.
//!   They can only be called from a primary command buffer when inside a render pass.
//! - **Secondary "compute" command buffers**. They can only contain non-render-pass-related
//!   commands (ie. everything but drawing, clearing, etc.) and cannot enter a render pass. They
//!   can only be called from a primary command buffer outside of a render pass.
//!
//! Using secondary command buffers leads to slightly lower performances on the GPU, but they have
//! two advantages on the CPU side:
//!
//! - Building a command buffer is a single-threaded operation, but by using secondary command
//!   buffers you can build multiple secondary command buffers in multiple threads simultaneously.
//! - Secondary command buffers can be kept alive between frames. When you always repeat the same
//!   operations, it might be a good idea to build a secondary command buffer once at
//!   initialization and then reuse it afterwards.
//!
//! # The `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`
//!
//! The most basic (and recommended) way to create a command buffer is to create a
//! [`AutoCommandBufferBuilder`](struct.AutoCommandBufferBuilder.html). Then use the
//! [`CommandBufferBuilder` trait](trait.CommandBufferBuilder.html) to add commands to it.
//! When you are done adding commands, use
//! [the `CommandBufferBuild` trait](trait.CommandBufferBuild.html) to obtain a
//! `AutoCommandBuffer`.
//!
//! Once built, use [the `CommandBuffer` trait](trait.CommandBuffer.html) to submit the command
//! buffer. Submitting a command buffer returns an object that implements the `GpuFuture` trait and
//! that represents the moment when the execution will end on the GPU.
//!
//! ```
//! use vulkano::command_buffer::AutoCommandBufferBuilder;
//! use vulkano::command_buffer::CommandBufferBuilder;
//! use vulkano::command_buffer::CommandBuffer;
//!
//! # let device: std::sync::Arc<vulkano::device::Device> = return;
//! # let queue: std::sync::Arc<vulkano::device::Queue> = return;
//! let cb = AutoCommandBufferBuilder::new(device.clone(), queue.family()).unwrap()
//!     // TODO: add an actual command to this example
//!     .build().unwrap();
//!
//! let _future = cb.execute(queue.clone());
//! ```
//!
//! # Internal architecture of vulkano
//!
//! The `commands_raw` and `commands_extra` modules contain structs that correspond to various
//! commands that can be added to command buffer builders. A command can be added to a command
//! buffer builder by using the `AddCommand<C>` trait, where `C` is the command struct.
//!
//! The `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` internally uses a `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` wrapped around
//! multiple layers. See the `cb` module for more information.
//!
//! Command pools are automatically handled by default, but vulkano also allows you to use
//! alternative command pool implementations and use them. See the `pool` module for more
//! information.
