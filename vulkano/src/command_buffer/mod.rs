//! Commands that the GPU will execute (includes draw commands).
//!
//! With Vulkan, before the GPU can do anything you must create a `CommandBuffer`. A command buffer
//! is a list of commands that will executed by the GPU. Once a command buffer is created, you can
//! execute it. A command buffer must be created even for the most simple tasks.
//!
//! # Pools
//!
//! Command buffers are allocated from pools. You must first create a command buffer pool which
//! you will create command buffers from.
//!
//! A pool is linked to a queue family. Command buffers that are created from a certain pool can
//! only be submitted to queues that belong to that specific family.
//!
//! # Primary and secondary command buffers.
//!
//! There are three types of command buffers:
//!
//! - **Primary command buffers**. They can contain any command. They are the only type of command
//!   buffer that can be submitted to a queue.
//! - **Secondary "graphics" command buffers**. They contain draw and clear commands. They can be
//!   called from a primary command buffer once a framebuffer has been selected.
//! - **Secondary "compute" command buffers**. They can contain non-draw and non-clear commands
//!   (eg. copying between buffers) and can be called from a primary command buffer outside of a
//!   render pass.
//!
//! Note that secondary command buffers cannot call other command buffers.
//!

// Implementation note.
// There are various restrictions about which command can be used at which moment. Therefore the
// API has several different command buffer wrappers, but they all use the same internal
// struct. The restrictions are enforced only in the public types.
