//! In the Vulkan API, command buffers must be allocated from *command pools*.
//!
//! A command pool holds and manages the memory of one or more command buffers. If you destroy a
//! command pool, all of its command buffers are automatically destroyed.
//!
//! In vulkano, creating a command buffer requires passing an implementation of the `CommandPool`
//! trait. By default vulkano will use the `StandardCommandPool` struct, but you can implement
//! this trait yourself by wrapping around the `UnsafeCommandPool` type.

/// Types that manage the memory of command buffers.

/// A Vulkan command pool must be externally synchronized as if it owned the command buffers that
/// were allocated from it. This includes allocating from the pool, freeing from the pool,
/// resetting the pool or individual command buffers, and most importantly recording commands to
/// command buffers.
///
/// The implementation of `CommandPool` is expected to manage this. For as long as a `Builder`
/// is alive, the trait implementation is expected to lock the pool that allocated the `Builder`
/// for the current thread.
///
/// > **Note**: This may be modified in the future to allow different implementation strategies.
///
/// The destructors of the `CommandPoolBuilderAlloc` and the `CommandPoolAlloc` are expected to
/// free the command buffer, reset the command buffer, or add it to a pool so that it gets reused.
/// If the implementation frees or resets the command buffer, it must not forget that this
/// operation must lock the pool.
