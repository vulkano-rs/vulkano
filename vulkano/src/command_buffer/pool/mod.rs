//! In the Vulkan API, command buffers must be allocated from *command pools*.
//!
//! A command pool holds and manages the memory of one or more command buffers. If you destroy a
//! command pool, all of its command buffers are automatically destroyed.
//!
//! In vulkano, creating a command buffer requires passing an implementation of the `CommandPool`
//! trait. By default vulkano will use the `StandardCommandPool` struct, but you can implement
//! this trait yourself by wrapping around the `UnsafeCommandPool` type.
