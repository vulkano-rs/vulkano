//! Device memory allocation and memory pools.
//!
//! By default, memory allocation is automatically handled by the vulkano library when you create
//! a buffer or an image. But if you want more control, you have the possibility to costumize the
//! memory allocation strategy.
//!
//! # Memory types and heaps
//!
//! A physical device is composed of one or more **memory heaps**. A memory heap is a pool of
//! memory that can be allocated.
//!
//! ```
//! // Enumerating memory heaps.
//! # let physical_device: vulkano::instance::PhysicalDevice = return;
//! for heap in physical_device.memory_heaps() {
//!     println!("Heap #{:?} has a capacity of {:?} bytes", heap.id(), heap.size());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! However you can't allocate directly from a memory heap. A memory heap is shared amongst one or
//! multiple **memory types**, which you can allocate memory from. Each memory type has different
//! characteristics.
//!
//! A memory type may or may not be visible to the host. In other words, it may or may not be
//! directly writable by the CPU. A memory type may or may not be device-local. A device-local
//! memory type has a much quicker access time from the GPU than a non-device-local type. Note
//! that non-device-local memory types are still accessible by the device, they are just slower.
//!
//! ```
//! // Enumerating memory types.
//! # let physical_device: vulkano::instance::PhysicalDevice = return;
//! for ty in physical_device.memory_types() {
//!     println!("Memory type belongs to heap #{:?}", ty.heap().id());
//!     println!("Host-accessible: {:?}", ty.is_host_visible());
//!     println!("Device-local: {:?}", ty.is_device_local());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Memory types are order from "best" to "worse". In other words, the implementation prefers that
//! you use the memory types that are earlier in the list. This means that selecting a memory type
//! should always be done by enumerating them and taking the first one that matches our criterias.
//!
//! ## In practice
//!
//! In practice, desktop machines usually have two memory heaps: one that represents the RAM of
//! the CPU, and one that represents the RAM of the GPU. The CPU's RAM is host-accessible but not
//! device-local, while the GPU's RAM is not host-accessible but is device-local.
//!
//! Mobile machines usually have a single memory heap that is "equally local" to both the CPU and
//! the GPU. It is both host-accessible and device-local.
//!
//! # Allocating memory and memory pools
//!
//! Allocating memory can be done by calling `DeviceMemory::alloc()`.
//!
//! Here is an example:
//!
//! ```
//! use vulkano::memory::DeviceMemory;
//!
//! # let device: std::sync::Arc<vulkano::device::Device> = return;
//! // Taking the first memory type for the sake of this example.
//! let ty = device.physical_device().memory_types().next().unwrap();
//!
//! let alloc = DeviceMemory::alloc(device.clone(), ty, 1024).expect("Failed to allocate memory");
//!
//! // The memory is automatically free'd when `alloc` is destroyed.
//! ```
//!
//! However allocating and freeing memory is very slow (up to several hundred milliseconds
//! sometimes). Instead you are strongly encouraged to use a memory pool. A memory pool is not
//! a Vulkan concept but a vulkano concept.
//!
//! A memory pool is any object that implements the `MemoryPool` trait. You can implement that
//! trait on your own structure and then use it when you create buffers and images so that they
//! get memory from that pool. By default if you don't specify any pool when creating a buffer or
//! an image, an instance of `StdMemoryPool` that is shared by the `Device` object is used.
