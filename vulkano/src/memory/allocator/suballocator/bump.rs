/// A [suballocator] which can allocate dynamically, but can only free all allocations at once.
///
/// With bump allocation, the used up space increases linearly as allocations are made and
/// allocations can never be freed individually, which is why this algorithm is also called *linear
/// allocation*. It is also known as *arena allocation*.
///
/// `BumpAllocator`s are best suited for very short-lived (say a few frames at best) resources that
/// need to be allocated often (say each frame), to really take advantage of the performance gains.
/// For creating long-lived allocations, [`FreeListAllocator`] is best suited. The way you would
/// typically use this allocator is to have one for each frame in flight. At the start of a frame,
/// you reset it and allocate your resources with it. You write to the resources, render with them,
/// and drop them at the end of the frame.
///
/// See also [the `Suballocator` implementation].
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// What happens is that every time you make an allocation, you receive one with an offset
/// corresponding to the *free start* within the [region], and then the free start is *bumped*, so
/// that following allocations wouldn't alias it. As you can imagine, this is **extremely fast**,
/// because it doesn't need to keep a [free-list]. It only needs to do a few additions and
/// comparisons. But beware, **fast is about all this is**. It is horribly memory inefficient when
/// used wrong, and is very susceptible to [memory leaks].
///
/// Once you know that you are done with the allocations, meaning you know they have all been
/// dropped, you can safely reset the allocator using the [`reset`] method as long as the allocator
/// is not shared between threads. This is one of the reasons you are generally advised to use one
/// `BumpAllocator` per thread if you can.
///
/// # Efficiency
///
/// Allocation is *O*(1), and so is resetting the allocator (freeing all allocations).
