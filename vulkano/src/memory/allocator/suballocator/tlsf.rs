/// A two-level segregated-fit [suballocator].
///
/// This should be your first choice of allocator because it's the best overall. Its performance is
/// better than the performance of both [`FreeListAllocator`] and [`BuddyAllocator`] at the cost of
/// only marginally worse [fragmentation] than `FreeListAllocator`'s. Its fragmentation is still
/// much better than `BuddyAllocator`'s.
///
/// This allocator can be thought of as something between `FreeListAllocator` and `BuddyAllocator`:
/// `BuddyAllocator` is a special case of an allocator employing segregated lists in that there is
/// only the power-of-two level of segregation and that it only coalesces buddies; the segregation
/// is *physical*. On the other hand, this *two-level* segregated-fit allocator has a power-of-two
/// level of segregation which is further segregated linearly. This means that it can find a free
/// suballocation that fits the requested size much better. Also, it can split and coalesce
/// suballocations willy-nilly like `FreeListAllocator`; the segregation is purely *logical*.
/// However, it doesn't use a best-fit strategy like `FreeListAllocator`, only a good-fit one,
/// making it much faster.
///
/// See also [the `Suballocator` implementation].
///
/// # Algorithm
///
/// There is one unsorted free-list for each size class, with two levels of segregation. The first
/// level segregates in increasing powers of two (e.g., \[16,&nbsp;32), \[32,&nbsp;64),
/// \[64,&nbsp;128), etc.), and the second level further segregates each first level linearly
/// (e.g., \[64,&nbsp;72), \[72&nbsp;80), \[80,&nbsp;88), etc.). When allocating, then, the first-
/// and second-level indices of the smallest size class where all suballocations fit the allocation
/// request (since the lists are unsorted) must be calculated, and a suballocation is removed from
/// this list. This is what gives the allocator its good-fit strategy. The suballocation is then
/// potentially trimmed at the ends, and the ends are added to their corresponding free-lists. The
/// front might need to be trimmed because of [alignment requirements] and the end because of a
/// larger than required size. When deallocating, the allocation is coalesced with the adjacent
/// suballocations if they are free, and the resulting suballocation is added to its corresponding
/// free-list.
///
/// # Efficiency
///
/// Calculating the first- and second-level indices for a suitable free-list to remove from for
/// allocation is done with only bitwise, arithmetic and conditional move instructions. Calculating
/// the first- and second-level indices for the free-list corresponding to a suballocation size is
/// even cheaper. This is what gives the allocator its excellent performance, and why both
/// allocation and deallocation is *O*(1). Resetting is also *O*(1).
