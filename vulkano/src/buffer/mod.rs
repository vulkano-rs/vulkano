//! Location in memory that contains data.
//!
//! A Vulkan buffer is very similar to a buffer that you would use in programming languages in
//! general, in the sense that it is a location in memory that contains data. The difference
//! between a Vulkan buffer and a regular buffer is that the content of a Vulkan buffer is
//! accessible from the GPU.
//!
//! Vulkano does not perform any specific marshalling of buffer data. The representation of the
//! buffer in memory is identical between the CPU and GPU. Because the Rust compiler is allowed to
//! reorder struct fields at will by default when using `#[repr(Rust)]`, it is advised to mark each
//! struct requiring imput assembly as `#[repr(C)]`. This forces Rust to follow the standard C
//! procedure. Each element is laid out in memory in the order of declaration and aligned to a
//! multiple of their alignment.
//!
//! # Various kinds of buffers
//!
//! The low level implementation of a buffer is [`RawBuffer`](crate::buffer::sys::RawBuffer).
//! This type makes it possible to use all the features that Vulkan is capable of.
//!
//! Instead you are encouraged to use one of the high-level wrappers that vulkano provides. Which
//! wrapper to use depends on the way you are going to use the buffer:
//!
//! - A [`DeviceLocalBuffer`] designates a buffer usually located in video memory and whose content
//!   can't be directly accessed by your application. Accessing this buffer from the GPU is
//!   generally faster compared to accessing a CPU-accessible buffer.
//! - A [`CpuBufferAllocator`] can be used to transfer data between the CPU and the GPU at a high
//!   rate.
//! - A [`CpuAccessibleBuffer`] is a simple buffer that can be used to prototype.
//!
//! Here is a quick way to choose which buffer to use. Do you often need to read or write the
//! content of the buffer? If so, use a `CpuBufferAllocator`. Otherwise, do you need to have access
//! to the buffer on the CPU? Then use `CpuAccessibleBuffer`. Otherwise, use a `DeviceLocalBuffer`.
//!
//! Another example: if a buffer is under constant access by the GPU but you need to read its
//! content on the CPU from time to time, it may be a good idea to use a `DeviceLocalBuffer` as the
//! main buffer and a `CpuAccessibleBuffer` for when you need to read it. Then whenever you need to
//! read the main buffer, ask the GPU to copy from the device-local buffer to the CPU-accessible
//! buffer, and read the CPU-accessible buffer instead.
//!
//! # Buffer usage
//!
//! When you create a buffer object, you have to specify its *usage*. In other words, you have to
//! specify the way it is going to be used. Trying to use a buffer in a way that wasn't specified
//! when you created it will result in a runtime error.
//!
//! You can use buffers for the following purposes:
//!
//! - Can contain arbitrary data that can be transferred from/to other buffers and images.
//! - Can be read and modified from a shader.
//! - Can be used as a source of vertices and indices.
//! - Can be used as a source of list of models for draw indirect commands.
//!
//! Accessing a buffer from a shader can be done in the following ways:
//!
//! - As a uniform buffer. Uniform buffers are read-only.
//! - As a storage buffer. Storage buffers can be read and written.
//! - As a uniform texel buffer. Contrary to a uniform buffer, the data is interpreted by the GPU
//!   and can be for example normalized.
//! - As a storage texel buffer. Additionally, some data formats can be modified with atomic
//!   operations.
//!
//! Using uniform/storage texel buffers requires creating a *buffer view*. See the `view` module
//! for how to create a buffer view.
//!
