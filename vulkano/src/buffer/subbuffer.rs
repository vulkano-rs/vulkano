/// A subpart of a buffer.
///
/// This type doesn't correspond to any Vulkan object, it exists for API convenience. Most Vulkan
/// functions that work with buffers take the buffer as argument as well as an offset and size
/// within the buffer, which we can represent with a single subbuffer instead.
///
/// `Subbuffer` also has a type parameter, which is a hint for how the data is going to be
/// interpreted by the host or device (or both). This is useful so that we can allocate
/// (sub)buffers that are correctly aligned and have the correct size for their content, and for
/// type-safety. For example, when reading/writing a subbuffer from the host, you can use
/// [`Subbuffer::read`]/[`Subbuffer::write`] without worrying about the alignment and size being
/// correct and about converting your data from/to raw bytes.
///
/// There are two ways to get a `Subbuffer`:
///
/// - By using the functions on [`Buffer`], which create a new buffer and memory allocation each
///   time, and give you a `Subbuffer` that has an entire `Buffer` dedicated to it.
/// - By using the [`SubbufferAllocator`], which creates `Subbuffer`s by suballocating existing
///   `Buffer`s such that the `Buffer`s can keep being reused.
///
/// Alternatively, you can also create a `Buffer` manually and convert it to a `Subbuffer<[u8]>`.

///
/// # Examples
///
/// Deriving the trait for sized types:
///
/// ```
/// # use vulkano::buffer::BufferContents;
/// #[derive(BufferContents)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct MyData {
///     x: f32,
///     y: f32,
///     array: [i32; 12],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Deriving the trait for unsized types works the same:
///
/// ```
/// # use vulkano::buffer::BufferContents;
/// #[derive(BufferContents)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct MyData {
///     x: f32,
///     y: f32,
///     slice: [i32],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This even works if the last field is a user-defined DST too:
///
/// ```
/// # use vulkano::buffer::BufferContents;
/// #[derive(BufferContents)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct MyData {
///     x: f32,
///     y: f32,
///     other: OtherData,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(BufferContents)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct OtherData {
///     slice: [i32],
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can also use generics if you please:
///
/// ```
/// # use vulkano::buffer::BufferContents;
/// #[derive(BufferContents)]
/// #[repr(C)]
/// struct MyData<T, U> {
///     x: T,
///     y: T,
///     slice: [U],
/// }
/// ```

///
/// ```

/// #[derive(BufferContents)]
/// #[repr(C)]

/// where

// If you absolutely *must* implement this trait by hand, here are the safety requirements (but

//
// - The type must be a struct and all fields must implement `BufferContents`.
// - `LAYOUT` must be the correct layout for the type, which also means the type must either be
//   sized or if it's unsized then its metadata must be the same as that of a slice. Implementing
//   `BufferContents` for any other kind of DST is instantaneous horrifically undefined behavior.
// - `ptr_from_slice` must create a pointer with the same address as the `slice` parameter that is
//   passed in. The pointer is expected to be aligned properly already.
// - `ptr_from_slice` must create a pointer that is expected to be valid for reads (and potentially
//   writes) for exactly `slice.len()` bytes. The `slice.len()` is expected to be valid for the
//   `LAYOUT`.
