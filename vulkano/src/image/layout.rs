/// > **Note**: In vulkano, image layouts are mostly a low-level detail. You can ignore them,
/// > unless you use an unsafe function that states in its documentation that you must take care of
/// > an image's layout.
///
/// In the Vulkan API, each mipmap level of each array layer is in one of the layouts of this enum.
///
/// Unless you use some sort of high-level shortcut function, an image always starts in either
/// the `Undefined` or the `Preinitialized` layout.
/// Before you can use an image for a given purpose, you must ensure that the image in question is
/// in the layout required for that purpose. For example if you want to write data to an image, you
/// must first transition the image to the `TransferDstOptimal` layout. The `General` layout can
/// also be used as a general-purpose fit-all layout, but using it will result in slower operations.
///
/// Transitioning between layouts can only be done through a GPU-side operation that is part of
/// a command buffer.
