//! Safe and rich Rust wrapper around the Vulkan API.
//!
//! # Starting off with Vulkano
//!
//! The steps for using Vulkan through Vulkano are in principle not any different from using
//! the raw Vulkan API, but the details may be different for the sake of idiomaticity, safety
//! and convenience.
//!
//! 1. Create a [`VulkanLibrary`]. This represents a Vulkan library on the system, which must be
//!    loaded before you can do anything with Vulkan.
//!
//! 2. Create an [`Instance`]. This is the API entry point, and represents an initialised Vulkan
//!    library.
//!
//! 3. If you intend to show graphics to the user on a window or a screen, create a [`Surface`].
//!    A `Surface` is created from a window identifier or handle, that is specific to the display or
//!    windowing system being used. Vulkano uses `raw-window-handle` to abstract over the different
//!    windowing systems. Note that you have to make sure that the `raw-window-handle` that your
//!    windowing library uses is compatible with the `raw-window-handle` that vulkano uses. For
//!    example, if you use a `winit` version that uses a different version from the one vulkano
//!    uses, you can add one of the [features](https://docs.rs/crate/winit/latest/features) that
//!    starts with `rwh` to `winit`. Currently, vulkano is compatible with `rwh_06`.
//!    
//! 4. [Enumerate the physical devices] that are available on the `Instance`, and choose one that
//!    is suitable for your program. A [`PhysicalDevice`] represents a Vulkan-capable device that
//!    is available on the system, such as a graphics card, a software implementation, etc.
//!
//! 5. Create a [`Device`] and accompanying [`Queue`]s from the selected `PhysicalDevice`. The
//!    `Device` is the most important object of Vulkan, and you need one to create almost every
//!    other object. `Queue`s are created together with the `Device`, and are used to submit work
//!    to the device to make it do something.
//!
//! 6. If you created a `Surface` earlier, create a [`Swapchain`]. This object contains special
//!    images that correspond to the contents of the surface. Whenever you want to change the
//!    contents (show something new to the user), you must first *acquire* one of these images from
//!    the swapchain, fill it with the new contents (by rendering, copying or any other means), and
//!    then *present* it back to the swapchain. A swapchain can become outdated if the properties
//!    of the surface change, such as when the size of the window changes. It then becomes
//!    necessary to create a new swapchain.
//!
//! 7. Record a [*command buffer*](command_buffer), containing commands that the device must
//!    execute. Then build the command buffer and submit it to a `Queue`.
//!
//! Many different operations can be recorded to a command buffer, such as *draw*, *compute* and
//! *transfer* operations. To do any of these things, you will need to create several other
//! objects, depending on your specific needs. This includes:
//!
//! - [*Buffers*] store general-purpose data on memory accessible by the device. This can include
//!   mesh data (vertices, texture coordinates etc.), lighting information, matrices, and anything
//!   else you can think of.
//!
//! - [*Images*] store texel data, arranged in a grid of one or more dimensions. They can be used
//!   as textures, depth/stencil buffers, framebuffers and as part of a swapchain.
//!
//! - [*Pipelines*] describe operations on the device. They include one or more [*shader*]s, small
//!   programs that the device will execute as part of a pipeline. Pipelines come in several types:
//!   - A [`ComputePipeline`] describes how *dispatch* commands are to be performed.
//!   - A [`GraphicsPipeline`] describes how *draw* commands are to be performed.
//!
//! - [*Descriptor sets*] make buffers, images and other objects available to shaders. The
//!   arrangement of these resources in shaders is described by a [`DescriptorSetLayout`]. One or
//!   more of these layouts in turn forms a [`PipelineLayout`], which is used when creating a
//!   pipeline object.
//!
//! - For more complex, multi-stage draw operations, you can create a [`RenderPass`] object. This
//!   object describes the stages, known as subpasses, that draw operations consist of, how they
//!   interact with one another, and which types of images are available in each subpass. You must
//!   also create a [`Framebuffer`], which contains the image objects that are to be used in a
//!   render pass.
//!
//! # `_unchecked` functions
//!
//! Many functions in Vulkano have two versions: the normal function, which is usually safe to
//! call, and another function with `_unchecked` added onto the end of the name, which is unsafe
//! to call. The `_unchecked` functions skip all validation checks, so they are usually more
//! efficient, but you must ensure that you meet the validity/safety requirements of the function.
//!
//! For all `_unchecked` functions, a call to the function is valid, if a call to the
//! corresponding normal function with the same arguments would return without any error.
//! This includes following all the valid usage requirements of the Vulkan specification, but may
//! also include additional requirements specific to Vulkano.
//! **All other usage of `_unchecked` functions may be undefined behavior.**
//!
//! Because there are potentially many `_unchecked` functions, and because their name and operation
//! can be straightforwardly understood based on the corresponding normal function, they are hidden
//! from the Vulkano documentation by default. You can unhide them by enabling the
//! `document_unchecked` cargo feature, and then generating the documentation with the command
//! `cargo doc --open`.
//!
//! # Cargo features
//!
//! | Feature              | Description                                                    |
//! |----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `macros`             | Include reexports from [`vulkano-macros`]. Enabled by default. |
//! | `document_unchecked` | Include `_unchecked` functions in the generated documentation. |
//! | `serde`              | Enables (de)serialization of certain types using [`serde`].    |
