//! Describes a graphical or compute operation.
//!
//! In Vulkan before you can add a draw or a compute command to a command buffer, you have to
//! create a *pipeline object* that describes it.
//!
//! There are two kinds of pipelines:
//!
//! - `ComputePipeline`s, for compute operations that reads/write raw pixels from images and
//!   buffers.
//! - `GraphicsPipeline`s, for graphical operations.
//!
//! All the sub-modules of this module (with the exception of `cache`) correspond to the various
//! steps of pipelines.
