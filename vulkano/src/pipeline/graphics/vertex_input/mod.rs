//! Configures how data from vertex buffers is read into vertex shader input locations.
//!
//! The vertex input stage is the stage where data is read from a buffer and fed into the vertex
//! shader. After each invocation of the vertex shader, the pipeline then proceeds to the input
//! assembly stage.
//!
//! # Input locations and components
//!
//! Input data is assigned per shader input location. Locations are set by adding the `location`
//! layout qualifier to an input variable in GLSL. A single location contains four data elements,
//! named "components", which are each 32 bits in size. These correspond to the `x`, `y`, `z` and
//! `w` (or equivalently `r`, `g`, `b`, `a`) components of a `vec4` inside the shader.
//! A component can contain at most one value, and data types that are smaller than 32 bits will
//! still take up a whole component, so a single `i8vec4` variable will still take up all four
//! components in a location, even if not all bits are actually used.
//!
//! A variable may take up fewer than four components. For example, a single `float` takes up only
//! one component, a `vec2` takes up two, and so on. Using the `component` layout qualifier in GLSL,
//! it is possible to fit multiple variables into a single four-component location slot, as long
//! as the components of each variable don't overlap.
//!
//! If the input variable is an array, then it takes up a series of consecutive locations. Each
//! element of the array always starts at a new location, regardless of whether there is still room
//! in the previous one. So, for example, an array of three `vec2` takes three locations, since
//! `vec2` alone needs one location. An array can be decorated with the `component` qualifier as
//! well; this is equivalent to applying the qualifier to every element of the array. If elements do
//! not use all components in their locations, those free components can be filled with additional
//! variables, just like for non-array types.
//!
//! Matrices are laid out as if they were an array of column vectors. Thus, a `mat4x3` is laid out
//! as an array of four `vec3`s, `mat2x4` as two `vec4`s. As with individual vectors, each column of
//! the matrix uses up as many components of its location as there are rows in the matrix, and the
//! remaining components are available for additional variables as described above. However, it is
//! not possible to use the `component` qualifier on a matrix.
//!
//! If a 64-bit value is to be passed to a shader, it will take up two adjacent components. Vectors
//! of 64-bit values are correspondingly twice as large: `dvec2` takes up all four components of a
//! location, `dvec4` takes two full locations, while `dvec3` takes one full location and the first
//! two components of the next. An array or matrix of a 64-bit type is made up of multiple adjacent
//! 64-bit elements, just like for smaller types: each new element starts at a fresh location.
//!
//! # Input attributes
//!
//! An input attribute is a mapping between data in a vertex buffer and the locations and components
//! of the vertex shader.
//!
//! Input attributes are assigned on a per-location basis; it is not possible to assign attributes
//! to individual components. Instead, each attribute specifies up to four values to be read from
//! the vertex buffer at once, which are then mapped to the four components of the given location.
//! Like the texels in an image, each attribute's data format in a vertex buffer is described by a
//! [`Format`]. The input data doesn't have to be an actual color, the format simply describes the
//! type, size and layout of the data for the four input components. For example,
//! `Format::R32G32B32A32_SFLOAT` will read four `f32` values from the vertex buffer and assigns
//! them to the four components of the attribute's location.
//!
//! It is possible to specify a `Format` that contains less than four components. In this case, the
//! missing components are given default values: the first three components default to 0, while the
//! fourth defaults to 1. This means that you can, for example, store only the `x`, `y` and `z`
//! components of a vertex position in a vertex buffer, and have the vertex input state
//! automatically set the `w` value to 1 for you. An exception to this are 64-bit values: these do
//! *not* receive default values, meaning that components that are missing from the format are
//! assigned no value and must not be used in the shader at all.
//!
//! When matching attribute formats to shader input types, the following rules apply:
//! - Signed integers in the shader must have an attribute format with a `SINT` type.
//! - Unsigned integers in the shader must have an attribute format with a `UINT` type.
//! - Floating point values in the shader must have an attribute format with a type other than
//!   `SINT` or `UINT`. This includes `SFLOAT`, `UFLOAT` and `SRGB`, but also `SNORM`, `UNORM`,
//!   `SSCALED` and `USCALED`.
//! - 64-bit values in the shader must have a 64-bit attribute format.
//! - 32-bit and smaller values in the shader must have a 32-bit or smaller attribute format, but
//!   the exact number of bits doesn't matter. For example, `Format::R8G8B8A8_UNORM` can be used
//!   with a `vec4` in the shader.
//!
//! # Input bindings
//!
//! An input binding is a definition of a Vulkan buffer that contains the actual data from which
//! each input attribute is to be read. The buffer itself is referred to as a "vertex buffer", and
//! is set during drawing with the
//! [`bind_vertex_buffers`](crate::command_buffer::AutoCommandBufferBuilder::bind_vertex_buffers)
//! command.
//!
//! The data in a vertex buffer is typically arranged into an array, where each array element
//! contains the data for a single vertex shader invocation. When deciding which element read from
//! the vertex buffer for a given vertex and instance number, each binding has an "input rate".
//! If the input rate is `Vertex`, then the vertex input state advances to the next element of that
//! buffer each time a new vertex number is processed. Likewise, if the input rate is `Instance`,
//! it advances to the next element for each new instance number. Different bindings can have
//! different input rates, and it's also possible to have multiple bindings with the same input
//! rate.
