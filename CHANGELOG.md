# Unreleased

# Version 0.6.2 (2017-09-06)

- Added checking compatibility between the descriptor sets and the pipeline object when adding a
  draw or compute command.
- Fixed several bugs in the validation checks of `blit_image`.
- Fixed `blit_image`, `copy_buffer_to_image` and `copy_image_to_buffer` not taking the mipmap level
  into account when checking for the correct image dimensions.
- Added `ImageDimensions::mipmap_dimensions()` and `ImageDimensions::num_mipmaps()`.
- Added an implementation of `DeviceOwned` for `QueuesIter` and `Queue`.
- Fixed the standard command pool and descriptor pool being destroyed too often.
- Added `#[allow(non_snake_case)]` to structs generated by vulkano-shaders.
