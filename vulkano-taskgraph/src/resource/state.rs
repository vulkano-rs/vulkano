/// Swapchains have Super Duper Uber Special<sup>TM</sup> synchronization needs. Namely, a
/// swapchain can't be used again after it has been recreated. This lock prevents that by assigning
/// each swapchain in the chain of swapchain (re)creations a *generation*, which is just a
/// monotonically increasing integer. When a swapchain is created, it gets a generation of 0, and
/// every subsequent recreation gets a generation one higher than the previous. The lock stores the
/// current generation and only successfully locks when the generation of the swapchain matches the
/// current generation. The lock can be locked for use in a task graph execution or for use in a
/// recreation. This ensures that a swapchain can't be used in more than one task graph execution
/// at a time since that would be UB, and that it can't be used in an execution and recreation at
/// the same time. The latter, coupled with the fact that a swapchain can't be used after being
/// recreated, allows us to remove a swapchain from which an image has never been acquired
/// immediately.
///
/// The swapchain can also be removed, which is similar to being locked except that this state is
/// final. Like with locking, removal is mutually exclusive and ensures that the swapchain can't be
/// used in a task graph execution when removed, which allows us to schedule the destruction of the
/// swapchain, any of its old swapchains, and sync objects after a device wait for idle.
