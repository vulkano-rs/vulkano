/// Swapchains have Super Duper Uber Special<sup>TM</sup> synchronization needs. Namely, a

/// every subsequent recreation gets a generation one higher than the previous. The lock stores the
/// current generation and only successfully locks when the generation of the swapchain matches the
/// current generation. The lock can be locked for use in a task graph execution or for use in a
/// recreation. This ensures that a swapchain can't be used in more than one task graph execution
/// at a time since that would be UB, and that it can't be used in an execution and recreation at
