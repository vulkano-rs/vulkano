- Fixed `ImageDimensions::mipmap_dimensions` and `max_mipmaps` in cases where the original size is not a power of two.
- Shader includes now work on Windows.
- **Breaking Change** Shader include directories passed to the `shader!` macro are now relative to the crates `Cargo.toml`
- Add support for `VK_KHR_16bit_storage` and `VK_KHR_storage_buffer_storage_class` device extensions.
- Update dependencies: lazy_static, half, syn, quote & proc-macro2
- Swapchain can now be recreated with dimensions of corresponding surface using `recreate()`.

# Version 0.15.0 (2019-10-18)

*Yanked*

# Version 0.14.0 (2019-08-17)

- Update shaderc to 0.6. This again allows to use locally installed libraries which reduces the build-time significantly on Arch/Voidlinux (see https://github.com/google/shaderc-rs/issues/58)
- Removed faulty debug_assert in `SwapchainAcquireFuture::drop`.
- Compressed texture formats can now be uploaded using `ImmutableImage::from_iter`, `ImmutableImage::from_buffer`, `AutoCommandBuilder::copy_buffer_to_image_dimensions`,
  and `AutoCommandBuilder::copy_buffer_to_image`.

# Version 0.13.0 (2019-07-02)

This is an emergency breaking breaking change. It fixes Undefined Behaviour that was preventing the compilation of Vulkano on the latest rust nightlies.

- Structs that have the `impl_vertex` macro applied to them, now also need to `#[derive(Default)]`.

# Version 0.12.0 (2019-05-24)

- Update shaderc to 0.5.  New shaderc has improved pre-built options for libshaderc that significantly reduce package build time and are appropriate for use in CI
- `QueueFamily::explicitly_supports_tranfers` only returns true if `vk::QUEUE_TRANSFER_BIT` is set instead of also always returning true.  Removed `supports_transfers`.
- Update to winit 0.19
- Add support for `#include "..."` and `#include <...>` directives within source
  files.
- Add a `union` method for the extensions types.
- Make `BufferUsage` derive `PartialEq` and `Eq`
- Fix a compiler error in struct code generated by the `shader!` macro.
- Improve inference of image layout transitions and in turn image memory barrier
  behaviour.

# Version 0.11.1 (2018-11-16)

- Expose `CopyImageError` and `DrawIndexedIndirectError`.

# Version 0.11.0 (2018-11-08) (**yanked** because vk-sys 0.3.4 was accidentally breaking vulkano 0.10)

- Update to winit 0.18
- Export features and device extensions from the device module instead of the instance module
    +   `instance::Features` -> `device::Features`
    +   `instance::DeviceExtensions` -> `device::DeviceExtensions`
    +   `instance::RawDeviceExtensions` -> `device::RawDeviceExtensions`
- Added `vulkano_shaders::shader!` proc macro, use this instead of `vulkano_shader_deriver::VulkanoShaders`.
- The entire `vulkano_shader_derive` crate is deprecated.
- `vulkano_shaders::{reflect, compile, Error}` are no longer public.
- Remove vulkano_shaders::build_glsl_shaders
- Removed mir support, as it is being removed from the vulkan spec.
- Split `PersistentDescriptorSetError::MissingUsage` into `MissingImageUsage` and `MissingBufferUsage`
  each with a matching enum indicating the usage that was missing.
- Fix instance_count when using draw_index with instance buffers
- Added a `reinterpret` function to `BufferSlice`
- Made `AttributeInfo` derive `Copy`, `Clone` and `Debug`
- Use [google/shaderc](https://github.com/google/shaderc-rs) for shader compilation
- Reject generation of rust types for SPIR-V arrays that would have incorrect array stride.
- Removed the `Layout` prefix of the descriptions used for a render pass.
- Implemented DescriptorSetCollection for `Vec<T>` which allows easier use of construction them for usage when drawing.

# Version 0.10.0 (2018-08-10)

  the window.
- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder::draw` and friends no longer consume the `DynamicState` argument, allowing reuse between calls.
- `Instance::new` and `Instance::with_loader` now take in the layers as an iterator of borrowed `str`s, not of references to
borrowed `str`s.

# Version 0.9.0 (2018-03-13)

# Version 0.7.1 (2017-09-28)

- Added `vulkano::pipeline::vertex::BufferlessDefinition` and `BufferlessVertices` to enable
  bufferless drawing.
