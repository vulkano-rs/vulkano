# Unreleased

- **Breaking ** DeviceMemoryBuilder::new() takes in `memory_index` rather than `MemoryType`.
- Fixed `shader!` generated descriptor set layouts for shader modules with multiple entrypoints.
  - **Breaking** Prefixed `shader!` generated descriptor set `Layout` structs with the name of the entrypoint the layout belongs to. For shaders generated from GLSL source, this means `Layout` has been renamed to `MainLayout`.
  - **Breaking** `shader!` will no longer generate descriptor information for variables that are declared but not used in a shader.
- **Breaking** `shader!` now accepts structs in shader interfaces decorated with `BufferBlock` rather than `Block`.
- **Breaking** Changes to image types:
  - Image types no longer implement `ImageViewAccess`.
  - `Dimensions` is removed. Image constructors now take `ImageDimensions`.
  - `ImageDimensions` no longer has the `cubemap_compatible` member. Instead, several image constructors take `ImageCreateFlags` which specifies this aspect.
  - Replaced the various functions of `UnsafeImage` to query format features and usage with two that simply return `Formatfeatures` and `ImageUsage`.
- **Breaking** Changes to image view handling:
  - Created a new `image::view` module for all image view related things.
  - Introduced a new `ImageView` type, a safe wrapper around `UnsafeImageView`.
  - The `ImageViewAccess` trait is renamed to `ImageViewAbstract`, some methods added, removed or renamed. `ImageView` implements this trait.
  - `UnsafeImageView` no longer holds image usage information, nor does it check for valid usage.
- **Breaking** `UnsafeCommandBuffer` and `SyncCommandBuffer` and their corresponding builders and other related types no longer have a type parameter for the command pool allocation, and no longer keep the command pool alive. Their constructors now take an `&UnsafeCommandPoolAlloc`. Users must now ensure that the pool allocation outlives the command buffers and their builders (`AutoCommandBuffer` does this itself).
- **Breaking** The `CommandBuffer` trait no longer has the `PoolAlloc` associated type, and has four new methods: `num_buffers`, `buffer`, `num_images` and `image`.
- Replaced deprecated `compare_and_swap` with `compare_exchange`.
- `UnsafeCommandPoolAlloc` now implements `DeviceOwned`.
- Allow `const` usage of features and `BufferUsage`.
- Opaque fd and dma-buf import support on `Linux`.
- `DeviceMemoryMapping` to separate device memory and mappings.
- Added external memory support for `DeviceLocalBuffer` for `Linux`
- Implemented synchronization for `SyncCommandBufferBuilder::execute_commands`.
- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder::execute_commands` is now fully safe to use.
- `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now becomes poisoned when it returns an error, to prevent using the builder in an inconsistent state.
- Fixed missing barriers in dispatch calls
  - **Breaking** `shader!` no longer marks descriptor sets as readonly as a fallback when it doesn't know
    - **Breaking** The keyword `readonly` might need to be added in front of the `buffer` keyword in GLSL files to get them working again
- Add support in `AutoCommandbufferBuilder::draw` for taking `[T; N]` in addition to `[T]`

# Version 0.21.0 (2021-03-05)

- **Breaking** `Message::layer_prefix` turned to Option to prevent segfaults when Vulkan message didn't provide `pMessageIdName` value
- **Breaking** On `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`, methods that bind a descriptor set now take a `dynamic_offsets` parameter
- **Breaking** On `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` and `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, the `update_buffer` method now takes `data` by reference
- **Breaking** Made `PipelineLayoutDescTweaks` public, for use with compute pipelines
- Added support for `ImageAspect` and YV12/NV12 formats,  for use with the UnsafeImage API.
- Added basic VK_KHR_external_memory, VK_KHR_external_memory_fd, and VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf support.
- Fixed potential segmentation fault in `ComputePipeline` when referencing `PipelineCache` objects.
- Fixed race condition in `StandardCommandPool` when allocating buffers.
- Fixed potential stack overflow error in loading large shaders by storing the bytecode as static.
- Fixed descriptor set layouts with arrays containing more than one element triggering unreachable code.
- Fixed panic on some machines when calling `Surface::capabilities`
- Added basic support and safety checks for dynamic uniform/storage buffers
- Updated dependencies:
  - `crossbeam` 0.7 -> 0.8
  - `half` 1.6 -> 1.7
  - `shaderc` 0.6 -> 0.7
  - `smallvec` 1.4 -> 1.6
  - `cgmath` 0.17 -> 0.18 (for examples)
  - `png` 0.15 -> 0.16 (for examples)
  - `time` 0.1 -> 0.2 (for examples)

- `FormatFeatures` now implements `Copy`.
- Removed the `AttachmentImageView` trait, which didn't appear to be used for anything anyway.

# Version 0.20.0 (2020-12-26)

- **Breaking** The `ImmutableImage::from_iter` and `ImmutableImage::from_buffer` can build Mipmaps
- **Breaking** `CpuAccessibleBuffer` now uses `RwLock` from `parking_lot`.
- **Breaking** The `Kind` and `SubpassContents` types have been moved to the root of the `command_buffer` module.
- **Breaking** On `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`, the methods `begin_render_pass` and `next_subpass` now take `SubpassContents` instead of a boolean value.
- **Breaking** The `CommandBuffer` trait now has an additional required method, `kind`.
- **Breaking** Update dependency `winit` 0.22 -> 0.24
- **Breaking** Added an Option to the ComputePipeline constructor to enable pipeline caching.
- Add support for 8bit storage.
- Some safety checks have been added to `execute_commands`/`execute_commands_from_vec` on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`, but not everything is checked yet so it's still unsafe to call.
- Added two vulkano-win features `raw-window-handle_` and `winit_` to be able to use vulkano without winit.
- Added function to create surface from `RawWindowHandle`.
- Added a `properties` method to `Format`.
- Added additional device feature flags for enabling SPIR-V related capabilities.
- Added method `copy_buffer_dimensions` that allows copying parts of buffers containing arrays.
- Added `debug_marker_begin`, `debug_marker_end` and `debug_marker_insert` to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`.
- Fixed surface creation function on Windows(PR #1410).
- Travis CI Linux Nightly job temporary disabled until #1423 resolved.
- Renamed feature from `shader_f3264` to `shader_float64`.
- Added method `build_with_cache` to the `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` that enables pipeline caching.
- Check usage bits on image when creating image view.
- Fixing an assertion panic in the SyncCommandBuffer. If the buffer encountered an error while locking the necessary resources, it would unlock all previously locked resources. Images were unlocked incorrectly and an assert in the image unlock function would panic.
- Added support for including precompiled shaders in vulkano-shaders using the `bytes` option.
- Added an option for Vulkano-Shaders macro to automatically generate standard
  traits(Default, PartialEq, etc) implementations for Rust types generated from
  the Shader types, and to derive these structs with external traits.
- Fixed clear `Cubemap` and `CubemapArray` framebuffer attachment dimensions; previously only 1/6th of the layers in each of these image layouts were actually considered by the framebuffer (for clearing and rendering). This seems to have been a result of the difference between `Dimensions` and `ImageDimensions`.

# Version 0.19.0 (2020-06-01)

- Update dependency `half` 1.5 -> 1.6
- Update MacOS dependency `metal` 0.17 -> 0.18
- Added additional checks around image/device compatibility.
- Fixed all warnings as of Rust 1.43.1
- Provides new API to fetch additional information of the Physical Device from the `PhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR` structure whenever it possible. In the current implementation only `subgroupSize` property is fetching. This interface can be extended in the future to obtain more metadata depending on community needs.
- `dynamic-local-size` compute shader example added showing how to utilize `subgroupSize` to compute and set shader's local size in run time.
- Fixed Vulkano Shaders bug when compute shader local group layout values bound to specialization constants. Now it is possible to define the layout in form of `layout(local_size_x_id = 12, local_size_y_id = 13, local_size_z = 1) in;` and then set the values as `SpecializationConstants {constant_12: 8, constant_13: 4, ...}`.
- Allow applications to access the instance and device pointers
- Add a helper function '.boxed()' on the `GpuFuture` that is short for `Box::new(yourFuture) as Box<dyn GpuFuture>`
