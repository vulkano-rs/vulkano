- **Breaking** Major changes have been made to most parts of the graphics pipeline state.
  - Each state category is now provided by a separate type ending in `State` that lives in its own submodule of `pipeline`. Some of these were existing types that were renamed.
  - Most of the state-setting methods on `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` are deprecated. State is now set using a `_state` method, which is given one of the above state types.
- **Breaking** `DynamicStateMode` is replaced with a simple `bool`.
- **Breaking** The presence of dynamic state in the pipeline state is now expressed more explicitly with two new types, `StateMode` and `PartialStateMode`.
- Added support for lots more dynamic state, most of which requires features or extensions to use.
- Added support for discard rectangles, in the `pipeline::discard_rectangle` module.
- Added support for line rasterization state, in the `pipeline::rasterization` module.
- Added support for color write enable state, in the `pipeline::color_blend` module.
- `GraphicsPipeline` now has methods to return each state object it was created with.
- `ash` has been updated to 0.33.3, which provides new features and extensions.
- Added `CommandBufferState::push_constants` to retrieve the set of all push constant bytes that have been set.
- Added check to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` to ensure that the push constants that are needed by the pipeline have been set.
- Added android platform to external memory cfgs.

# Version 0.26.0 (2021-10-2)

- **Breaking** The `draw` and `draw_indexed` commands on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` now take parameters to explicitly specify the range of vertices and instances to draw.
- **Breaking** `BufferlessDefinition` is removed.
- **Breaking** The `VertexSource` trait is removed, and has been replaced with the new `VertexBuffersCollection` trait, which works analogously to `DescriptorSetsCollection`. Vertex buffers can now be passed in as a tuple, just like descriptor sets.
- **Breaking** Removed the vertex definition type parameter from `GraphicsPipeline`, which is no longer needed with the change above.
- **Breaking** The `ComputePipelineAbstract` and `GraphicsPipelineAbstract` traits are no longer needed and have been removed, with their methods made available on the base `ComputePipeline` and `GraphicsPipeline` types.
- **Breaking** Changes to `DescriptorDesc` and related changes:
  - The variants of `DescriptorDescTy` now match those of `DescriptorType` and Vulkan.
  - The `array_count` and `readonly` members are renamed to `descriptor_count` (to match Vulkan) and `mutable` (with the opposite sense, to match familiar Rust usage).
  - `DescriptorImageDesc` is renamed to `DescriptorDescImage`. The `dimensions` and `arrayed` members have been combined into a single `ImageViewType` value.
  - Removed the `arrayed` member of the `InputAttachment` variant as well, as the standard now explicitly disallows arrayed input attachments.
  - The `ensure_superset_of` method has been split into two, one for shader compatibility and one for binding descriptor sets. The error return types of these methods have been revised.
- **Breaking** The `Cubemap` and `CubemapArray` variants of `ImageViewType` are renamed to `Cube` and `CubeArray` to match Vulkan.
- **Breaking** Setting state in `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` is now done via separate commands (e.g. `bind_descriptor_sets`, `bind_vertex_buffers`) instead of being provided with dispatch/draw commands. This matches how these commands work in Vulkan.
  - Validity of the state is checked by the dispatch/draw commands.
  - `DynamicState` is removed; each individual state now has its own command to set it. This includes some states that were not previously included in `DynamicState`.
- **Breaking** `StateCacher` is removed; its task is now partially handled by `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`.
- **Breaking** Many traits now require `Send + Sync`: `BufferAccess`, `ImageAccess`, `ImageViewAbstract`, `FramebufferAbstract`, `AttachmentsList`, `MemoryPoolAlloc`, `DescriptorSet`, `DescriptorPoolAlloc`, `PrimaryCommandBuffer`, `SecondaryCommandBuffer`, `CommandPoolAlloc`. This further means that any type parameters of types implementing these traits also require `Send + Sync`.
- **BREAKING** `DescriptorSetLayout::new()` now returns `Result<Self, DescriptorSetLayoutError>` instead of Result<Self, OomError>`
- **BREAKING** `DescriptorCompatibilityError` additional variant `VariableCount`.
- **BREAKING** `GraphicsPipelineCreationError` additional variant `PipelineLayoutCreationError`.
- **BREAKING** `PipelineLayoutCreationError` additional variant `SetLayoutError`.
- **BREAKING** `FixedSizeDescriptorSetsPool` has been replaced by `SingleLayoutDescSetPool`.
- **BREAKING** Set builders now return `&mut Self` instead of `Self` & methods take values wrapped in an `Arc`.
- **Breaking** Changes to `Format`:
  - `Format` variants are now all uppercase with underscores. This avoids interpretation problems where the underscore is significant for the meaning.
  - The `ty` method and the `FormatTy` enum are removed. They are replaced with the `NumericType` enum, which concerns itself only with the numeric representation and not with other properties. There are now three `type_*` methods to retrieve it, for colour, depth and stencil respectively.
  - The `planes` method now returns a slice containing the equivalent single-plane formats of each plane.
- **Breaking** The `ImageAccess` trait no longer has the `has_color`, `has_depth` and `has_stencil` methods. This information can be queried using the `aspects` or `type_*` methods of `Format`.
- **Breaking** Changes made to `DescriptorDescTy` to support immutable samplers.
- **Breaking** `DescriptorWrite::combined_image_sampler` now takes the sampler in an `Option`. Use `None` when the descriptor has immutable samplers.
- **Breaking** Changes to pipeline layout tweaks:
  - `DescriptorSetDesc::tweak` is renamed to `set_buffer_dynamic`, and now takes only a single binding index.
  - `DescriptorSetDesc::tweak_multiple` is removed.
  - The dynamic buffers parameter of `GraphicsPipelineBuilder::with_auto_layout` has been replaced with a closure that can be used to make tweaks to the descriptor set layouts as needed.
  - `ComputePipeline::new` has an additional closure parameter identical to the one described above.
- **Breaking** `AttachmentImage::dimensions()` now returns `[u32; 3]` which includes the layer count.
- **Breaking** Buffers and Images that have `with_exportable_fd` use dedicated allocation, thus requiring khr_get_memory_requirements2 and khr_dedicated_allocation on top of 
already needed khr_external_memory and khr_external_memory_fd.
- **Breaking** `Compare` is renamed to `CompareOp` to match Vulkan.
- Added `export_fd` and `with_exportable_fd` to `AttachmentImage` and `StorageImage` as well as `mem_size` which is needed when using those images with Cuda.
- Vulkano-shaders: added extension/feature checks for more SPIR-V capabilities.
- Added support for surface creation from a CAMetalLayer using VK_EXT_metal_surface.
- Bug fixed. Image layout passed to SubImage is now being respected
- The full Rust code is now generated from vk.xml by autogen directly, instead of using intermediate macros.
- Added `storage_buffer()` method to `BufferUsage`.
- Fixed mismatched types on Android.
- Fixed bug in descriptor set validity checking that allowed drawing/dispatching with descriptor sets that didn't match the pipeline.
- Fixed bug where the wrong functions were used for retrieving physical device info.
- Fixed minor bug in retrieving features from the physical device.
- Add BSD platforms to external memory (dma-buf fd) cfgs
- Added support for `u8` index buffers with the `ext_index_buffer_uint8` extension.
- Descriptor sets now support variable count descriptors.
    - e.g. `layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D textures[];`
- Non-breaking `Format` additions:
  - Formats and their metadata are now auto-generated from vk.xml. This significantly expands the support for YCbCr formats in particular.
  - The `compatibility` method returns an object that can be used to check the compatibility of two formats, explained [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap43.html#formats-compatibility-classes).
  - The `components` method returns the number of bits in each colour component.
  - The `compression` method returns the compression scheme as a new enum, `CompressionType`.
  - The `requires_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` method returns whether the "sampler YCbCr conversion" must be enabled on an image view and sampler in order to use this format.
  - `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` now uses `Vec` instead of `SmallVec` internally to reduced stack usage.
- Added support for descriptors with immutable samplers.
  - They are included as separate members on the appropriate variants of `DescriptorDescTy`.
  - Added a `set_immutable_samplers` method to `DescriptorSetDesc`, which lets you set the immutable samplers for a descriptor. This can be used together with the closure provided to pipeline constructors.
  - `add_image` can be used when building a descriptor set, to provide an image to a combined image sampler descriptor that has immutable samplers.
- Updated dependencies:
  - png 0.16 > 0.17
  - time 0.2 > 0.3
- `AttachmentImage::current_layer_levels_access()` now returns the correct range which solves pipeline barriers only affecting the first layers of of a multi-layer `AttachmentImage`.
- A new Vulkano-shaders macro option `shaders` to compile several shaders in a single macro invocation producing generated Rust structs common for all specified shaders without duplications. This feature improves type-safe interoperability between shaders.
- Fixed CommandBufferExecFuture adding the command buffer to queue submission after being flushed.
- Added a `spirv` module to the main crate, which contains an auto-generated parser for SPIR-V files, and various other utilities that can be used to analyze shaders at runtime.
- `DescriptorSetLayout` now has `variable_descriptor_count` which returns the descriptor count in a variable count descriptor if present.
- Additional copy buffer to image checks.
- Add `clear_depth_stencil_image` to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` to clear depth / stencil images.
- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` and `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now have a `state` method, which can be used to query the state set by previous "bind" and "set" commands.
- Changed parameters requiring an iterator so that they now take `IntoIterator`, for more flexibility.
- Removed various custom iterator types in favour of returning `impl Iterator`.
- Replaced the various dynamic state querying methods of `GraphicsPipeline` with two: `dynamic_state` to query a single dynamic state, and `dynamic_states` to iterate over all of them.


# Version 0.25.0 (2021-08-10)

- **Breaking** Refactoring of `PhysicalDevice` and related types.
  - The module `instance::physical_device` is moved to `device::physical`. Items are exported directly from there.
  - Functions on `PhysicalDevice` that previously returned a custom iterator type now return `impl ExactSizeIterator`.
  - `PhysicalDevice` now has new methods `supported_extensions` and `required_extensions`. The equivalent constructors on `DeviceExtensions` are deprecated, but still present.
- **Breaking** Renamed `Device::loaded_extensions` to `enabled_extensions`, to match the terminology used for `enabled_features` as well as the Vulkan standard.
- **Breaking** Renamed `Instance::loaded_extensions` and `loaded_layers` to `enabled_extensions` and `enabled_layers` respectively.
- **Breaking** Major reorganisation of the `descriptor` module. Most importantly, its `descriptor_set` child is moved to the crate root and everything is placed under there. Full list of module changes:
  - `descriptor::descriptor_set::*` > `descriptor_set`.
  - `descriptor::descriptor::*` > `descriptor_set::layout`.
    - But `ShaderStages*` are moved to `pipeline::shader`.
  - `descriptor_set::UnsafeDescriptorSetLayout` > `descriptor_set::layout::DescriptorSetLayout` (renamed).
  - `descriptor_set::DescriptorSetDesc` > `descriptor_set::layout`.
  - `descriptor_set::{FixedSize*}` > `descriptor_set::fixed_size_pool`.
    - Re-exported `descriptor_set::FixedSizeDescriptorSetsPool`.
  - `descriptor_set::{Persistent*}` > `descriptor_set::persistent`.
    - Re-exported `descriptor_set::PersistentDescriptorSet`, `descriptor_set::PersistentDescriptorSetBuildError`, `descriptor_set::PersistentDescriptorSetError`.
  - `descriptor_set::{DescriptorPool*, DescriptorsCount, UnsafeDescriptorSetPool*}` > `descriptor_set::pool`.
  - `descriptor_set::{StdDescriptorPool*}` > `descriptor_set::pool::standard`.
    - Re-exported `descriptor_set::pool::StdDescriptorPool`.
  - `descriptor_set::{DescriptorWrite, UnsafeDescriptorSet}` > `descriptor_set::sys`.
  - `descriptor_set::collection` is now private.
- **Breaking** `Features::superset_of` is renamed to `is_superset_of`.
- **Breaking** The `VertexDefinition` trait no longer has `AttribsIter` and `BuffersIter` as associated types. It instead returns a `VertexInput`.
- **Breaking** The various types for vertex definitions (except `BufferlessDefinition`) have been replaced with the new `BuffersDefinition` type, which can handle any number of vertex and instance buffers. Examples of how it's used can be seen in the "instancing" and "teapot" examples.
- **Breaking** `InputRate` has been renamed to `VertexInputRate` to match the Vulkan name. The `Instance` variant now has a `divisor` member.
- **Breaking** `DescriptorSetDesc` is converted from a trait to a struct. `DescriptorSetLayout` can take this struct in its constructor, as alternative to the iterator which was already possible previously.
- **Breaking** `PipelineLayout` is now built from a list of descriptor set layouts and push constant ranges, like in plain Vulkan. It no longer constructs its own descriptor set layouts internally.
- **Breaking** `PipelineLayoutDescPcRange` is renamed to `PipelineLayoutPcRange`.
- **Breaking** `PipelineLayoutDesc` is no longer needed and is removed. Its functionality has been moved to `DescriptorSetDesc` and `PipelineLayoutPcRange`. This also applies to `ComputeEntryPoint`, `GraphicsEntryPoint` and `EntryPointAbstract`.
- **Breaking** `PipelineLayout` now has a `descriptor_set_layouts` method which returns a slice of all the layouts, replacing the previous `descriptor_set_layout` which only returned one at a time.
- **Breaking** Vulkano is now relaying on features from **Rustc >= 1.53.0**.
- **Breaking** The boolean `graphics` parameter on the `bind_descriptor_sets` method of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` and `StateCacher` has been replaced with a new enum `PipelineBindPoint`.
- **Breaking** Known physical device properties (VkPhysicalDeviceProperties, VkPhysicalDeviceLimits, VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties) are now no longer `Option<T>`.
  - These properties are available with every `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2` call.
  - Add some `Default` instances to make the auto trait happy.
- **Breaking** Values that represent a size, offset or index on the device are now represented as `DeviceSize` (a type alias of `u64`).
- **Breaking** Fix in push constant ranges with intersecting stage flags.
- Added support for the `ext_vertex_attribute_divisor` extension, via the new `BuffersDefinition` type and the additions to `VertexInputRate`.
- Added `is_superset_of` method to `DeviceExtensions` and `InstanceExtensions`.
- Examples now enable only the features they need instead of all of them.
- Examples have much smarter device selection logic. In the triangle example this is supplied with comments.
- Errors checking(by unwrapping) in `MappedDeviceMemory::read_write`.
- Add creation of Semaphores with exportable Linux file descriptor on.
- Add method to export file descriptor corresponding to Semaphore.
- `SemaphoreBuilder` introduced.

- Vulkano-shaders now provides the image format for descriptors, if the shader requires a specific format.
- Vulkano-shaders now uses the `spirv_headers` crate for some of its types.
- Large allocations now use dedicated allocations which improves memory efficiency.
- Add `Clone` interface for `LayerProperties`.
- Fixed detection of storage buffers in SPIR-V so that it works for all SPIR-V versions.
- Added `VertexInput` type, which contains the binding and attribute descriptions.
- Added a `vertex_input` method to `GraphicsPipelineAbstract`, which returns a reference to the vertex input.

- Fixed synchronization bug where pipeline barriers were placed based on the binding of resources instead of the draw/dispatch calls that use them.
- `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` accept any `IntoIterator` where they previously only accepted `Iterator`.
- Updated ash to 0.33.0, vk.xml to 1.2.185, and ran `cargo update` to update other dependencies' patch versions.
- Add support for EXTENDED_SRGB_NONLINEAR_EXT color space.
- Better error message for wrong color space value
- Added `impl BitOr` for `debug::MessageType` and `debug::MessageSeverity` and some bit field generators, also turning them into `const fn`.

# Version 0.24.0 (2021-06-20)

- **Breaking** Vulkano-shaders now checks if the device supports the shader's SPIR-V version, when loading the shader.
- **Breaking** (but unlikely) Vulkano-shaders now compiles to SPIR-V 1.0 by default. If your shader needs features only available in a higher version, you can specify the target version on the `shader!` macro with the new `vulkan_version: "major.minor"` and `spirv_version: "major.minor"` arguments.
- **Breaking** Changes to how image sample counts are represented.
  - Instead of an integer, functions with a parameter for number of image samples now take a value of `SampleCount`, an enum with variants named `SampleN`, where `N` is a power-of-two integer. It can be converted to a Vulkan `SampleCountFlags`, and from an integer with `try_from`.
  - `sample_counts` field is originaly represented as u32 type, which is now represented by `SampleCounts` struct-type which is a boolean collection of supported `sample_counts`. It can be converted to and from a Vulkan `SampleCountFlags`.
- **Breaking** Changes to shader interfaces and pipeline layouts.
  - The module `descriptor::pipeline_layout` has been renamed to `pipeline::layout`.
  - The trait `ShaderInterfaceDef` has been replaced by a simple struct `ShaderInterface`, and its `elements` method returns a slice instead of an iterator. This means you no longer need to define a new type for a shader interface. The accompanying type `ShaderInterfaceDefEntry` has been renamed to `ShaderInterfaceEntry` to match. The `ShaderInterfaceDefMatch` trait and `EmptyShaderInterfaceDef` struct have been removed.
  - The trait `PipelineLayoutDesc` has also been converted into a struct, with methods `descriptor_sets` and `push_constants` which return slices. It is functionally equivalent to the old `RuntimePipelineDesc` type, which is now merged into it. The traits `PipelineLayoutSuperset`, `PipelineLayoutSetsCompatible` and `PipelineLayoutPushConstantsCompatible` have been integrated into this struct as well. The `EmptyPipelineDesc` trait has been replaced with an `::empty()` constructor.
  - Consequently, functions that took a value of these traits now take a plain `ShaderInterface` or `PipelineLayoutDesc`. Types that had a type parameter for it no longer have it, e.g. `VertexDefinition`, `GraphicsEntryPoint`, `GraphicsEntryPointAbstract`, `PipelineLayout`.
  - Now that `PipelineLayout` has no more type parameter, the trait `PipelineLayoutAbstract` is removed. The layout type parameter is also removed from `ComputePipeline` and `GraphicsPipeline`.
  - `ComputeEntryPoint` and `GraphicsEntryPoint` now take a value specifying the push constants descriptor, instead of having a type parameter. The corresponding associated type on `EntryPointAbstract` has been removed.
  - The `GraphicsEntryPointAbstract` trait has been removed. `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` now takes a `GraphicsEntryPoint` object directly, and has lifetime parameters for the 5 shader types instead. `EntryPointDummy` is no longer needed and has been removed.
- **Breaking** The constructors of `Instance` now take an additional argument to specify the maximum API version.
- **Breaking** Vulkano is now built on top of [Ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash) instead of vk-sys.
  - The `EntryPoints`, `InstancePointers` and `DevicePointers` types from vk-sys have been replaced with a new module `fns` containing `EntryFunctions`, `InstanceFunctions` and `DeviceFunctions`. Rather than containing the functions directly, there is a member for each Vulkan version and extension, which is loaded from Ash.
  - The functions to retrieve the function pointers have been renamed to `fns`.
  - The `TYPE` associated constant has been removed from the `VulkanObject` trait. This is now provided by the Ash `Handle` trait, which the object returned by `internal_object` must implement.
- **Breaking** `RawInstanceExtensions` and `RawDeviceExtensions` have been removed. The `Instance` and `Device` constructors now take `&InstanceExtensions` and `&DeviceExtensions` respectively. The `loaded_extensions` function returns these reference types as well.
- **Breaking** The restrictions of each enabled extension and feature are checked when creating an instance or device.
- **Breaking** Physical device properties are now retrieved through a new `properties` method, returning a `&Properties` reference.
  - To allow for the possibility that not every property is known by the physical device, fields in `Properties` are wrapped by an `Option`.
  - The previous methods for retrieving properties, `name`, `ty`, `limits`, `driver_version`, `pci_device_id`, `pci_vendor_id`, `uuid` and `extended_properties`, have been removed.
  - The `api_version` method remains, but there is now a semantic difference between it and the version reported by `properties`: The raw property gives the maximum supported version that the driver itself reports, while the method on `PhysicalDevice` returns the version a logical device would support if it were created from this physical device (that is, restricted by the instance's `max_api_version`).
- **Breaking** `ImageAccess` trait method `try_gpu_lock()` now has an additional argument to allow locking the image in an uninitialized state.`
- **Breaking** The `conflicts_buffer` and `conflicts_image` methods on the `BufferAccess` and `ImageAccess` traits are removed.
- **Breaking** Draw and dispatch calls on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` no longer have a parameter for dynamic offsets. Instead, they are provided as part of the descriptor sets parameter. They are added to each descriptor set individually using the new `offsets` method on the `DescriptorSet` trait. `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `StateCacher` likewise take dynamic offsets as part of the descriptor set.
- **Breaking** `StencilFaceFlags` is renamed to `StencilFaces`, and its variants are also shortened.
- **Breaking** `DynamicStencilValue` now contains a `front` and a `back` value.
- **Breaking** The stencil state commands of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now take a `StencilFaces` value and a `u32` instead of `DynamicStencilValue`.
- Improve `ImageLayout` checks to prevent `AccessError::ImageNotInitialized` from occurring where the image is safe to use uninitialized.
- Added `DeviceExtensions::khr_spirv_1_4`, which allows SPIR-V 1.4 shaders in Vulkan 1.1.
- Added `FunctionPointers::api_version` to query the highest supported instance version.
- Added `Instance::api_version` and `Device::api_version` to return the actual supported Vulkan version. These may differ between instance and device, and be lower than what `FunctionPointers::api_version` and `PhysicalDevice::api_version` return.
- Added `Instance::max_api_version`, which returns the maximum version that was specified when creating the instance.
- Fixed the issue when creating a buffer with exportable fd on Linux(see to #1545).
- The `draw_indirect` and `draw_indexed_indirect` commands on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` now check the draw count against the `max_draw_indirect_count` limit.
- Fixed a few documentation errors.
- It is now possible to construct a graphics pipeline without a fragment shader.
- Added support for all core Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 device features.
- Updated winit to 0.25.
- Fixed the teapot example on ArchLinux (GTX 1650).
- Added support for the SPIR-V draw parameters capability.
- Added support for the VK_KHR_multiview extension. 
- Vulkano-shaders: Added support for MultiView SPIR-V capability.
- Multiview example added showing how to utilize the VK_KHR_multiview extension to render to multiple layers of a framebuffer at once.
- All Vulkan extensions supported by Ash are now provided in `InstanceExtensions` and `DeviceExtensions`. This includes all but the very newest extensions; new extensions should be added whenever Ash is updated to a new version.
- Every extension is now documented with a link to its Vulkan page and information about requirements, conflicts, promotion and deprecation.
- `InstanceExtensions` and `DeviceExtensions` now have a `From` implementation that takes an iterator of `&CStr`. There is also a `From` implementation for `Vec<CString>` that performs the reverse conversion.
- All Vulkan features supported by Ash are now provided.
- Implement fmt::Display for DisplayMode.
- Clarify return value is in millihertz for DisplayMode.refresh_rate()
- Reworked some of the internals of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, so that a mutex is no longer needed and resource conflict detection is simplified.
- `Features::all` and `Features::none` are now `const fn`.

# Version 0.23.0 (2021-04-10)

- **Breaking** Changes to command buffers:
  - `AutoCommandBuffer` and the `CommandBuffer` trait have been split in two, one for primary and the other for secondary command buffers. `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` remains one type, but has a type parameter for the level of command buffer it will be creating, and some of its methods are only implemented for builders that create `PrimaryAutoCommandBuffer`.
  - The `Flags` enum is renamed to `CommandBufferUsage`, and is exported from the main `command_buffer` module. The `None` variant is renamed to `MultipleSubmit`.
  - Simplified the number of constructors on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` by adding a `CommandBufferUsage` parameter.
  - `Kind` has been renamed to `CommandBufferLevel`, and for secondary command buffers it now contains a single `CommandBufferInheritance` value.
  - `CommandBufferInheritance::occlusion_query` and `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder::begin_query` now take `QueryControlFlags` instead of a boolean.
- **Breaking** The non-default constructors of `ImageView` have been replaced with a builder, created with `ImageView::start(image)`.
- **Breaking** Added support for component mapping/swizzling on image views.
  - `image::Swizzle` is moved and renamed to `image::view::ComponentMapping`. It now has an `is_identity` method.
  - A non-default component mapping can now be specified for image views, via the new builder. A `ComponentMapping` parameter has been added to `UnsafeImageView` as well.
  - The `identity_swizzle` method on the `ImageViewAbstract` trait has been replaced with `component_mapping`, which returns a `ComponentMapping` directly.
  - Storage image and input attachment descriptors now check for identity swizzling when being built.
- **Breaking** Major rearranging of framebuffer and render pass-related types:
  - The `framebuffer` module is renamed to `render_pass`.
  - `RenderPassDesc` is now a struct, not a trait. The methods have been simplified, returning a slice reference to the `attachments`, `subpasses` and `dependencies`.
    - Renamed: `AttachmentDescription` > `AttachmentDesc`, `PassDescription` > `SubpassDesc`, `PassDependencyDescription` > `SubpassDependencyDesc`.
    - `EmptySinglePassRenderPassDesc` is replaced with the `RenderPassDesc::empty` constructor, or its `Default` implementation.
    - The `RenderPassCompatible`, `RenderPassDescClearValues` and `RenderPassSubpassInterface` traits are removed, their functionality is moved to `RenderPassDesc`.
  - `RenderPass` takes a concrete `RenderPassDesc` value for construction, and no longer has a type parameter.
    - The `RenderPassAbstract` trait is removed.
    - `GraphicsPipeline` and `Framebuffer` no longer have a render pass type parameter.
    - `GraphicsPipelineAbstract` and `FramebufferAbstract` have trait methods to retrieve the render pass instead.
  - The `ordered_passes_renderpass!` and `single_pass_renderpass!` macros are unchanged externally.
- Support for queries:
  - **Breaking** `UnsafeQueryPool`, `UnsafeQuery` and `UnsafeQueriesRange` have `Unsafe` removed from their names.
  - **Breaking** `QueriesRange` is now represented with a standard Rust `Range` in its API.
  - **Breaking** The secondary command buffer constructors that have parameters for queries will check if the corresponding features are enabled, and return a different error type.
  - Removed `OcclusionQueriesPool`, which was incomplete and never did anything useful.
  - `get_results` has been added to `QueriesRange`, to copy query results to the CPU.
  - The following functions have been added to both `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`: `begin_query` (still unsafe), `end_query` (safe), `write_timestamp` (still unsafe), `copy_query_pool_results` (safe), `reset_command_pool` (still unsafe).
  - Better documentation of everything in the `query` module.
  - An example demonstrating occlusion queries.
- **Breaking** Improved the handling of image aspects a little, with the enum `ImageAspect` and the struct `ImageAspects`. `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilderImageAspect` has been removed.
- **Breaking** Removed the separate structs for each image format. Now, only the `Format` enum exists.
  - Traits that no longer make sense in this context have been removed: `FormatDesc`, the `Possible*FormatDesc` traits, `StrongStorage`.
  - In types that had a type parameter for the format type, it has been removed.
  - `AcceptsPixels` has been converted to `Pixel`, which is implemented on the pixel type rather than on the format type.
- **Breaking** `shader!` will generate descriptor information for all variables declared in the shader module, even if they are not used. *This reverts the default behavior from the last release.*
  - **Breaking** Added the `exact_entrypoint_interface` option to `shader!` to force vulkano to only generate descriptor information for variables that are used. (the default behavior from the last release)
- **Breaking** `AccessFlagBits` is renamed to `AccessFlags`.
- **Breaking** Minor refactor of `UnsafeBuffer`:
  - Replaced the various usage functions with a single `usage` function, mirroring the change made earlier to `UnsafeImage`.
  - The `SparseLevel::sparse` member is removed, and `UnsafeBuffer::new` takes `Option<SparseLevel>` instead.
- **Breaking** `Swapchain` is now constructed using a builder. `Swapchain::start` will start building a new blank swapchain. Calling `recreate` on an existing swapchain will create a builder filled with all the properties of the old swapchain.
- Added two methods to `Format`: `planes` to query the number of planes in the format, and `aspects` to query what aspects an image of this type has.
- The deprecated `cause` trait function on Vulkano error types is replaced with `source`.
- Fixed bug in descriptor array layers check when the image is a cubemap.
- Vulkano-shaders: Fixed and refined the generation of the `readonly` descriptor attribute. It should now correctly mark uniforms and sampled images as read-only, but storage buffers and images only if explicitly marked as `readonly` in the shader.
- Vulkano-shaders: Added support for StoragePushConstant8 SPIR-V capability.
- Fixed a bug which caused a segfault when extending memory allocation info in DeviceMemoryBuilder
- `BufferlessDefinition` and `BufferlessVertices` now derive `Copy` and `Clone`. This allows `GraphicsPipelineBuilder`s that have not yet defined a vertex buffer type to be cloned.
- Various functions for converting to/from Vulkan flags have been consolidated into implementations of the standard `From` trait.
- Export root-level `entry_point` method on `loader::FunctionPointers` type.
- Add few more `InstanceExtensions` from KHR and EXT.

# Version 0.22.0 (2021-03-31)

- **Breaking** Updated all code to Rust 2018 edition.
- **Breaking** DeviceMemoryBuilder::new() takes in `memory_index` rather than `MemoryType`.
- Fixed `shader!` generated descriptor set layouts for shader modules with multiple entrypoints.
  - **Breaking** Prefixed `shader!` generated descriptor set `Layout` structs with the name of the entrypoint the layout belongs to. For shaders generated from GLSL source, this means `Layout` has been renamed to `MainLayout`.
  - **Breaking** `shader!` will no longer generate descriptor information for variables that are declared but not used in a shader.
- **Breaking** `shader!` now accepts structs in shader interfaces decorated with `BufferBlock` rather than `Block`.
- Fixed missing barriers in dispatch calls
  - **Breaking** `shader!` no longer marks descriptor sets as readonly as a fallback when it doesn't know
    - **Breaking** The keyword `readonly` might need to be added in front of the `buffer` keyword in GLSL files to get them working again
- **Breaking** Changes to image types:
  - Image types no longer implement `ImageViewAccess`.
  - `Dimensions` is removed. Image constructors now take `ImageDimensions`.
  - `ImageDimensions` no longer has the `cubemap_compatible` member. Instead, several image constructors take `ImageCreateFlags` which specifies this aspect.
  - Replaced the various functions of `UnsafeImage` to query format features and usage with two that simply return `Formatfeatures` and `ImageUsage`.
- **Breaking** Changes to image view handling:
  - Created a new `image::view` module for all image view related things.
  - Introduced a new `ImageView` type, a safe wrapper around `UnsafeImageView`.
  - The `ImageViewAccess` trait is renamed to `ImageViewAbstract`, some methods added, removed or renamed. `ImageView` implements this trait.
  - `UnsafeImageView` no longer holds image usage information, nor does it check for valid usage.
- **Breaking** `UnsafeCommandBuffer` and `SyncCommandBuffer` and their corresponding builders and other related types no longer have a type parameter for the command pool allocation, and no longer keep the command pool alive. Their constructors now take an `&UnsafeCommandPoolAlloc`. Users must now ensure that the pool allocation outlives the command buffers and their builders (`AutoCommandBuffer` does this itself).
- **Breaking** The `CommandBuffer` trait no longer has the `PoolAlloc` associated type, and has four new methods: `num_buffers`, `buffer`, `num_images` and `image`.
- **Breaking** structures passed to `ImmutableBuffer::from_data` and `CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_data` must implement [`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) to ensure soundness of these functions
- Replaced deprecated `compare_and_swap` with `compare_exchange`.
- `UnsafeCommandPoolAlloc` now implements `DeviceOwned`.
- Allow `const` usage of features and `BufferUsage`.
- Opaque fd and dma-buf import support on `Linux`.
- `DeviceMemoryMapping` to separate device memory and mappings.
- Added external memory support for `DeviceLocalBuffer` for Linux.
- Implemented synchronization for `SyncCommandBufferBuilder::execute_commands`.
- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder::execute_commands` is now fully safe to use.
- `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now becomes poisoned when it returns an error, to prevent using the builder in an inconsistent state.
- Added a `dispatch_indirect` command to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`.

# Version 0.21.0 (2021-03-05)

- Removed the `AttachmentImageView` trait, which didn't appear to be used for anything anyway.
- Added support and validation for the `mutable_format` and `block_texel_view_compatible` image creation flags.
- Added `format` to the `ImageViewBuilder`, to choose a different format from the underlying image.

# Version 0.20.0 (2020-12-26)

- **Breaking** The `ImmutableImage::from_iter` and `ImmutableImage::from_buffer` can build Mipmaps
- **Breaking** `CpuAccessibleBuffer` now uses `RwLock` from `parking_lot`.
- **Breaking** The `Kind` and `SubpassContents` types have been moved to the root of the `command_buffer` module.
- **Breaking** On `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`, the methods `begin_render_pass` and `next_subpass` now take `SubpassContents` instead of a boolean value.
- **Breaking** The `CommandBuffer` trait now has an additional required method, `kind`.
- **Breaking** Update dependency `winit` 0.22 -> 0.24
- **Breaking** Added an Option to the ComputePipeline constructor to enable pipeline caching.
- Add support for 8bit storage.
- Some safety checks have been added to `execute_commands`/`execute_commands_from_vec` on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`, but not everything is checked yet so it's still unsafe to call.
- Added two vulkano-win features `raw-window-handle_` and `winit_` to be able to use vulkano without winit.
- Added function to create surface from `RawWindowHandle`.
- Added a `properties` method to `Format`.
- Added additional device feature flags for enabling SPIR-V related capabilities.

- Added method `build_with_cache` to the `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` that enables pipeline caching.
- Check usage bits on image when creating image view.
- Fixing an assertion panic in the SyncCommandBuffer. If the buffer encountered an error while locking the necessary resources, it would unlock all previously locked resources. Images were unlocked incorrectly and an assert in the image unlock function would panic.
- Added support for including precompiled shaders in vulkano-shaders using the `bytes` option.
- Added an option for Vulkano-Shaders macro to automatically generate standard
  traits(Default, PartialEq, etc) implementations for Rust types generated from
  the Shader types, and to derive these structs with external traits.
- Fixed clear `Cubemap` and `CubemapArray` framebuffer attachment dimensions; previously only 1/6th of the layers in each of these image layouts were actually considered by the framebuffer (for clearing and rendering). This seems to have been a result of the difference between `Dimensions` and `ImageDimensions`.

- Added additional checks around image/device compatibility.
- Fixed all warnings as of Rust 1.43.1
- Provides new API to fetch additional information of the Physical Device from the `PhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR` structure whenever it possible. In the current implementation only `subgroupSize` property is fetching. This interface can be extended in the future to obtain more metadata depending on community needs.
- `dynamic-local-size` compute shader example added showing how to utilize `subgroupSize` to compute and set shader's local size in run time.
- Fixed Vulkano Shaders bug when compute shader local group layout values bound to specialization constants. Now it is possible to define the layout in form of `layout(local_size_x_id = 12, local_size_y_id = 13, local_size_z = 1) in;` and then set the values as `SpecializationConstants {constant_12: 8, constant_13: 4, ...}`.
- Allow applications to access the instance and device pointers
